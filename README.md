# Project Name
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## Conclusions
- As per our final model, the top 3 predictor variables that influences bike bookings are:
- Temperature (positive predictive power)
- Year (positive predictive power)
- weathersit_light_rain_&_snow	(negative predictive power)
### Thus, management should give importance to these three variables to achieve maximum bike bookings and thus make maximum profit.
